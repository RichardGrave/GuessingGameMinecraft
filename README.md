# Guessing game

## iOS game in Swift 3
A couple of years ago I made this guessing game for my kids.\
Because my kids love Minecraft, I made it with a Minecraft theme.

When I started this project, Swift 3 was the newest version Apple made available.\
So that's why it's in Swift 3 and not a newer version.

I was curious about Swift at that time and I just wanted to create something\
and learn from it. So I created this in couple of days (or a week, I don't remember exactly).

For an experienced Swift developer this code may look like rubbish\
and maybe I could have done things better/different,\
but for somebody like me who has just started learning Swift this looks pretty good ;)
 
##### Additional info
I don't have a developer account, so this is NOT in Apple's App Store.\
I installed it on my kids their iPad every time they wanted to play with the game.
